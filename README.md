# Simple Minecraft Shaders

If you want to play with shaders in Minecraft, here's the simplest possible shader to get started with (it just inverts your screen), along with some hints on how to make your own.

I realize this readme is lacking in detail... Hit me up with questions in the Issues and I'll fill in what's missing!

## Installing

You'll need the shaders mod, but then you can take the `Inverter` folder and drop it in the `shaderpacks` folder in your Minecraft resources folder.

## Coding

Take a look at `Inverter/shaders/final.fsh` and play around! The language you're using is called GLSL. http://thebookofshaders.com/ is a good introduction (though it's not specifically about Minecraft).
